            We are a small dedicated team of honest caring guys with almost 50 years of experience between the two stores. We have two locations well situated with parking at each one. The Downtown store is at 774 Bay st on the backside of the Wendy's parking lot. The Langford store is at #758 Goldstream Ave right smack in the middle of Langford Centre. (map links available at the bottom of this page)
            <br><br>
            In our 17 years we have built great relationships with the surrounding businesses and community. We service many of Victoria's small businesses with our outstanding refurbished product and very quick turn around on repair work.
